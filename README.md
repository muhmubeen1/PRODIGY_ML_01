# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict the price of houses using a machine learning model, specifically Linear Regression. The dataset consists of various attributes of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, etc., which are used as features to train the model.

## Introduction

House prices are influenced by a variety of factors including location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, age of the property, and more. By using these features, this project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains several features, including but not limited to:
- `LotArea`: Size of the lot in square feet
- `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality
- `YearBuilt`: Year the house was built
- `BedroomAbvGr`: Number of bedrooms above ground
- `TotalBsmtSF`: Total square footage of the basement
- `GrLivArea`: Above-ground living area square footage
- `FullBath`: Number of full bathrooms

The target variable is the `SalePrice`, which represents the price at which the house was sold.

## Model

The machine learning algorithm used in this project is **Linear Regression**. This method is used to fit a model that captures the relationship between the features (independent variables) and the house prices (dependent variable).

### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing data, encode categorical features, and scale the data if necessary.
2. **Feature Selection:** Select relevant features based on correlation or feature importance.
3. **Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training:** Train the Linear Regression model on the training data.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Dependencies

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook (or Python script) to train the model and make predictions:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```
   Or if using a Python script:
   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

5. The model will output predictions for house prices based on the input attributes in the test data.
